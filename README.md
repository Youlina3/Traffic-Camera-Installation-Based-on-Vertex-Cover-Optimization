# Traffic-Camera-Installation-Based-on-Vertex-Cover-Optimization
The idea is for the police to be able to **minimize** the number of cameras they need to install, and still be as effective as possible with their monitoring."driver.cpp" uses pipe to link random graph generator(rgen.cpp), intersection calculator(parser.py,intersect.py) and shortest path calculator(shortest_path_calculator.cpp, graph.h,graph.cpp).For more details, "rgen.cpp" takes command-line arguments continuously generate random graphs. "intersect.py" implements an algorithm to get street intersections and certain street segments after a parser (parser.py). "shortest_path_calculator.cpp" implements Dijkstra's algorithm to get shortest path between different intersections. "ece650-a4.cpp" uses MiniSat library (a SAT solver) to calculate minimum vertex cover. 
In MnimumVertexCover folder, there are three algorithms to approximately solve minimum vertex cover (NPC) problem and compare these three different approxiamate algorithms by runing them concurrently.
