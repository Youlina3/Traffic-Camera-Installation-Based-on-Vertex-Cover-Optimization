# Traffic-Camera-Installation-Based-on-Vertex-Cover-Optimization
The idea is for the police to be able to minimize the number of cameras they need to install, and still be as effective as possible with their monitoring."ece650-a3.cpp" uses pipe to link random graph generator(rgen.cpp) and intersections calculator(ece650-a1) and shortest path calculator(ece650-a2).For more details, "rgen.cpp" Takes command-line arguments continuously generate random graphs. "intersect.py" implements an algorithm to get street intersections and certain street segments after a parser (ece650-a1.py). "ece650-a2.cpp" implements Dijkstra's algorithm to get shortest path between different intersections. "ece650-a4.cpp" uses MiniSat library (a SAT solver) to calculate minimum vertex cover. 
In MnimumVertexCover folder, there are three algorithms to solve minimum vertex cover problem.
